Essential oils are often used in aromatherapy, a form of alternative medicine that employs plant extracts to support health and well-being.
<br><br>
Essential oils are compounds extracted from plants.
<br><br>
The oils capture the plant’s scent and flavor, or “essence.”
<br><br>
Unique aromatic compounds give each essential oil its characteristic essence.
<br><br>
Essential oils are obtained through distillation (via steam and/or water) or mechanical methods, such as cold pressing.
<br><br>
Once the aromatic chemicals have been extracted, they are combined with a carrier oil to create a product that’s ready for use.
